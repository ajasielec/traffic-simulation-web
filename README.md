# ðŸš¦ Intersection Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates traffic at an intersection. The simulation can be run via the command line or accessed through a web interface.

## Installation & Setup
First, clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/ajasielec/traffic-simulation-web.git
```
Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies using Maven:
```
mvn clean install
```

## Running the simulation
### Command Line Execution
To start the simulation with specified input and output JSON files, run:
```
mvn exec:java "-Dexec.args=input.json output.json"
```
**Note: Ensure that the JSON input file is located in the *src/main/resources* folder.**

If no arguments are provided, the program will generate a random simulation with 10 commands by default:
```
mvn exec:java
```
While running, the simulation prints status updates to the console with a delay. 
Results are saved in the specified output JSON file or in randomOutput.json in the *src/main/resources*.
Additionally, a randomInput.json file will be created with the randomly generated commands.


To run tests, use:
```
mvn test
```

### Web interface
To launch the backend server, run:
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Once the backend is running, access the simulation at:
http://localhost:8080


## How It Works
The simulation reads a JSON file containing commands (either provided by the user or randomly generated) and executes them step by step.

### Commands
There are two types of commands: 
* **addVehicle** - Adds a vehicle to the intersection on specified road.
* **step** - Advances the simulation by allowing vehicles to pass through the intersection to the end road. Vehicles from the most occupied roads are processed first and added to the leftVehicles list.

### Simulation Process

1. The simulation initializes an intersection instance and loads commands from the input file.
2. When executing an addVehicle command:
   *  The system adds a vehicle to the specified starting road at intersection (vehicles are placed in queues).
3. When executing a step:
   * The system checks if the traffic lights should switch, prioritizing the roads with more vehicles.
   * Traffic flows according to the active green light, removing vehicles from queues and adding them to the leftVehicles list.
   * The step results are saved to the step status list.
4. After executing every command, simulation results are saved to the specified output file.
5. The program also supports real-time updates via WebSockets, sending the current simulation state (traffic lights, added vehicles, etc.) to the frontend.

### Web Interface Functionality

When running the backend, you can start the simulation via the web interface:
* Enter input and output file names or choose a random simulation with a specified number of commands.
* Click the "Start Simulation" button to trigger the simulation via an API request.
* The results and status updates are displayed in real time in the simulation output window.
